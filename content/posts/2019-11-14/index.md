I saw a lot of big projects/repositories with hundreds or even thousands of stale branches where nothing really happens.
Usually, no one cares to clean up all this mess. There is a nice simple GitHub tweak where you can prevent this.

## Automatically delete merged branches

Github branches can be automatically deleted after press on the merge button.

You need to be a **repository admin**:

1.  Navigate to repository **Settings**

2.  Scroll down to the **"Merge button"** section
3.  Activate **Automatically delete head branches** checkbox

Merged something accidentally and want your branch back? Don't worry, you'll be able to restore deleted branched.
