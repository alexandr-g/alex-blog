As a professional Software Developer living in Berlin, I like to support cool companies and products from Berlin. I was an early adopter of N26 mobile banking (sadly it does not give me any benefits and they canceled my account because of my nationality). [Blinkist](https://www.blinkist.com/) is one of those cool companies with HQ in Berlin and I **really like** what they are doing.

No promotion included, I like Blinkist and just giving my personal opinion here and what I found helpful that might help you as well.

## What is Blinkist?

In busy times like ours, we often do not have to read. I like to read but often don't find time for it.

Whenever I'm on the go or cooking something at home I like to listen to podcasts or audiobooks.

> Blinkist lets you read the key lessons from 3000+ nonfiction books in 15 min or fewer.

What they offer are web and mobile apps with a great selection of books in different categories like productivity, personal development, etc. I like that you can listen to audio and read one "Blink" on a subway. Although I commute mostly by bike for health and environmental reasons. I think it's great to get an overview of the most important ideas from the book withing 15 mins.

## One year in review with Blinkist premium

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/o6qTD4G.jpg" width="250" />

I completed 50+ blinks in one year. I don't think that is a lot and I'm pretty sure some people are reading this amount in two months or so but it is what it is.

## Premium features

You can install Blinkist ios and android app and start with a **free plan**. In a free plan, you can read one blink or title completely free. If it's not enough you can try Premium plan for 7 days for free.

In the premium plan, you have access to any titles at any time and can sync your highlights to external apps like Evernote.

## Extending subscription

Although I'm not using this app to the full extent I extended the subscription for another year as well. I just like the idea.

It was a good price for the Black Friday season. I found it on [mydealz](https://www.mydealz.de/deals/blinkist-sachbucher-in-15-minuten-50-auf-jahresabo-1476947) (German only description of the deal)

I hope you find something helpful in this post! Thanks and see you in the next one!
