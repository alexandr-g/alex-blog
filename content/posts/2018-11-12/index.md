Back in the September this year I visited for the first time San Francisco. It was my first visit to the USA and first transatlantic flight.

Oh, man! It was great. 

**Route:** Berlin - München, München - SFO

**Travel time:** 14+ hours

**Conference ticket price**: $250

I met so many great people during my trip and stayed for a week in the downtown SF.

## Day one - guided tour
Before the conference we met with the guys for the Friday Fun Day activities in the Ferry Building Marketplace to grab some Blue Bottle Coffee (I got the trend, huh!). It was a great opportunity get to know each other better before the conference begins, meet organizers and just enjoy the guided tour with cable cars rides. The tour was leaded by the conference organizer [Benjamin Dunphy](https://twitter.com/Benghamine). Thanks Ben for the great organization and showing us spectacular views! :)

## Day one - lunch break
After walking around Russian Hill and enjoying good lunch we separated and went for sightseeing. Checked out Golden Gate Bridge, Lombard street and surroundings. After chilling in Mission dolores Park we took a ride to Microsoft Reactor building for the conference opening.

I feel like Mission dolores Park is my favorite place in SF along with the Golden Gate Park :)

## Day one - Topic Tables
Topic Tables was very interesting experience for me. You get around the tables with presenters and discuss what is interesting to you. It encourages informal communication with the presenters for talks so that you can ask all the questions and discuss topics you're interested the most. I had a good chats with the guys about GraphQL, functional lenses by	
James McNamara, accessability etc.


## Day two - main event - conference talks
We've got a full day of talks from leading experts in the JS/React community. 

I was impressed that all the talks are interesting and very, very good quality. From slides to how people present, it was engaging and inspiring.

You can find recordings here https://twitter.com/reactathon

## Venue 
We spend full conference day with the talks in the GitHub HQ. I pleased to see GitHub main office and also grab a bunch of presents from Real World React and sponsors. Stickers of course! Amazing environment there. Enjoyed playing ping pong with [Max](https://twitter.com/maxmarchuk). Heey Max!


## Thanks

I want give a big thank you to organizers, speakers and all the people I've met and had a chat with. You rock!

...and all the other amazing folks!

It was much more to it which I can't unfortunately fit in this article. I would recommend everyone to do something like this. It was 100% worth the long flight. I've stayed for one week in the SF and enjoyed my experiences very much despite of the shocking (for me) situation in the downtown and all this homeless people around.

Stay safe, stay curious!
