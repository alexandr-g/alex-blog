Hey, it's me again! Today is a bit chilled stuff to read.

Last year, in September I completed my first intercontinental flight and attended to the [Reactathon 2018 React Conference](https://grischuk.de/reactathon-2018-react-conference-in-san-francisco) in San Francisco.

However, this year I decided to do something different. I don't feel like flying a long-distance and selected Spain as my conference destination.

## Numbers

**Route:** Berlin - Barcelona-El Prat

**Travel time:**

* one-way flight: ~2h 45 mins
* bus transfer to **Sitges**: ~30 mins

**Conference ticket price**:

I bought _Super Early Bird_ which cost ‚Ç¨545 + ‚Ç¨114.45 that's 21% **Spanish VAT** which is crazy üòú

**Total**: ‚Ç¨659.45

I have to admit that's the most expensive conference I've ever been to.

## What is [Full Stack Fest 2019](https://2019.fullstackfest.com/)?

> A 3-day, single-track conference with a workshops day about topics ranging from **GraphQL**, WebAssembly, the JAMStack & Progressive User Interfaces to HTTP/3, Automation Testing, Serverless, and the P2P web.

> No matter if you consider yourself a backend, frontend developer, or anywhere in-between, Full Stack Fest is for you.

Which is taking place each year in **Sitges**. That's about 30 mins ride from Barcelona üèñ

## üå¥ Arrival üå¥

Arrival was pretty smooth despite the early morning. The Barcelona-El Prat is a huge airport with a bit confusing connection between two terminals. You can get from 1 to 2 and vice-versa only by bus.

Barcelona greets you with a ray of warm sunshine and palm trees.

## Day before the conference

I arrived one day before the conference and walked around the city.

**Random fact**: I didn't know before that Sitges is a very popular gay üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàdestination.

It is a beautiful resort town with lots of sun and a lovely atmosphere.

## Conference opening and overview

The venue was part of Hotel Meli√† specifically dedicated to us. Hotel Meli√† is located closer to the Port of Sitges but I stayed in the city center. So, I had a nice 10-15 mins walk along the coast in the morning before the conference starts.

There were around ~500 participants. Huge thanks to organizers for managing all of that. Lite breakfast with coffee, lunch and multiple breaks over the day was included. That helps a lot to focus on the conference talks and socializing.

Not surprised that there were a lot of people from **Berlin**.

## Talks

Pretty much all the talks were interesting for me so I took notes and learned something new. I liked talks on Accessibility, Rust, WebAssembly with WASI, Agda programming language, CSS tips and tricks, glimpse into HTTP/3 and TC39 JavaScript standards, GitHub Actions, future of Serverless.

In particular, I can highlight:

* [Applied Accessibility: Practical Tips for Building More Accessible Front-Ends by
  SARA SOUEIDAN](https://conferences.codegram.com/talks/applied-accessibility:-practical-tips-for-building-more-accessible-front-ends-fsf2019)

Thanks for this CSS trick

### Summary

**Full Stack Fest 2019** is a great conference in a very pleasurable place. I would definitely recommend visiting it at least once (this is not a sponsored post, it's just my opinion). I like the place, organization is top, venue, quality of talks and interesting presenters.

More than that, you can combine this trip and stay a few days in Barcelona over the weekend.

From a technical perspective, it was interesting for me as a Frontend Developer. Although, if you're doing only backend or DevOps that probably would not be that much interesting to you. They tried to balance talks, but still, I feel like it was a lot of frontend related stuff.

The only concern I had that it is a bit expensive but it is definitely worth it.
