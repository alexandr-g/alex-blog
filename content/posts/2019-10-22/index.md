October is a perfect month for me to contribute to Open Source Software because of Hacktoberfest. Hacktoberfest 2019 is a great initiative for new and experienced developers to explore, learn and contribute to the OSS.

> Congratulations on submitting four (or more) pull requests and contributing to open source projects this month.

Feels good! Last time I've completed Hacktoberfest was in 2017 and received a nice T-shirt from [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/b8faee442765) - btw, get a **\$50 credit** if you register from my link.

## The Original - DigitalOcean/Dev.to - Hacktoberfest 2019

**Swag**: T-shirt, stickers

**Requirements**: 4 pull requests in any repository

**How to sign up:** [Hacktoberfest Website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)

**Notes**: All PRs count unless the repo has been marked spam, or the PR is marked as spam or invalid.

## Contributions

This year I've contributed to the [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) package. Fully automated version management and package publishing.

**semantic-release** is a great way to do pain-free automatic releases. I use it to automatically release our React UI components library which is a part of the Design System. It uses specific commit messages conventions, like **fix**, **feat**, **chore**, **docs** and based on those commits it will figure out version bump and create your changelog automatically. Trust me, you'll love it! Just try for your library.

## Tips

- familiarize yourself with the source code, rules and the repo you're going to contribute to.
- navigate to the GitHub issues in that repo and look for labels like: `help wanted`, `good first issue` or `hackocoberfest`.
- start with something small - that could be even some docs improvements.
- read the contributors guidelines carefully.

ðŸ’»Happy codding!
