October is a perfect month for me to contribute to the Open Source Software because of Hacktoberfest. Hacktoberfest 2019 is a great initiative for new and experienced developers to explore, learn abd contribute to the OSS.

Feels good! Last time I've completed Hacktoberfest was in 2017 and received a nice T-shirt from [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/b8faee442765) - btw, get a **$50 credit** if you register from my link.

## Contribute

This year I've contributed to the [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) package. Fully automated version management and package publishing.

**semantic-release** is a great way for a pain free automatic releases. I use it for automatically release our React UI components library which is a part of Design System. It uses specific commit messages conventions, like **fix**, **feat**, **chore**, **docs** and based on those commits it will figure out version and create your backlog automatically. Trust me, you'll love it! Just try for your library.
